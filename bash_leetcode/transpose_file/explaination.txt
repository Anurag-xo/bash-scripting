Let's break down this AWK script line by line:

1. First part - Processing each line:
```bash
{
    # Store number of rows
    if (NR == 1) {
        cols = NF
    }
```
- NR is a built-in AWK variable that means "Number of Records" (current line number)
- NF means "Number of Fields" in the current line
- When processing first line (NR == 1), we store the number of columns (NF)

2. Array storage part:
```bash
    # Store each element in a 2D array
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        matrix[i, NR] = $i
    }
    rows = NR
```
- For each field in the current line:
  - i tracks the column number
  - NR is the row number
  - $i refers to the field value at position i
  - matrix[i, NR] creates a 2D array where first index is column and second is row
- rows = NR keeps track of total number of rows

3. END block - Printing the transposed matrix:
```bash
END {
    # Print transposed matrix
    for (i = 1; i <= cols; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j <= rows; j++) {
            printf "%s", matrix[i,j]
            if (j < rows) {
                printf " "
            }
        }
        printf "\n"
    }
}
```
- END block executes after all lines are processed
- Outer loop (i) iterates through columns
- Inner loop (j) iterates through rows
- printf "%s", matrix[i,j] prints each element
- if (j < rows) adds space between elements except last one
- printf "\n" adds newline after each transposed row

Example with input:
```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```

How the matrix is stored:
```
matrix[1,1] = "name"    matrix[2,1] = "age"
matrix[1,2] = "alice"   matrix[2,2] = "21"
matrix[1,3] = "ryan"    matrix[2,3] = "30"
```

When printed in transposed form:
```
name alice ryan
age 21 30
```

This is efficient because:
1. Processes file line by line
2. Uses minimal memory (just storing the matrix)
3. Handles any number of rows and columns
4. Preserves data formatting
