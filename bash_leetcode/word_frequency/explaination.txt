This command pipeline processes the words.txt file to count the occurrences of each unique word in descending order. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part:

cat words.txt
This reads the contents of words.txt.

tr -s ' ' '\n'
This replaces all sequences of spaces with a newline (\n), effectively putting each word on its own line and removing extra spaces.

sort
This sorts the words alphabetically, which groups identical words together.

uniq -c
The uniq -c command counts occurrences of each unique line (or word, in this case, because each word is on a new line from tr -s and sort).

sort -nr
This sorts the output from uniq -c numerically (-n) and in reverse order (-r), so words with the highest count appear first.

awk '{print $2, $1}'
This rearranges the output to display the word first, followed by its count. Here:

$2 is the word.
$1 is the count.
