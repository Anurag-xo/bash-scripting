# Bash Scripting Showcase

This repository is a collection of Bash scripts that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in shell scripting. From basic operations to more complex tasks, these scripts serve as a practical guide and a reference for anyone looking to improve their Bash scripting skills.

## Getting Started

To run any of the scripts in this repository, you will need a Bash-compatible shell. You can execute the scripts directly from your terminal.

For example, to run the `script.sh` file:

```bash
./script.sh
```

Make sure that the script has execute permissions. If not, you can grant them using the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
